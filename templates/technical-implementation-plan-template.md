# [Feature-name] technical implementation plan

| **Status:** [status] <!-- One of: Draft | In Review | Approved | In Progress | Completed | On Hold | Cancelled -->
| **Owner:** [owner] <!-- GitHub username of implementation owner -->
| **Target Date:** [date] | <!-- ISO format: DD-MM-YYYY -->

## Dependencies

- [dependencies] <!-- List of dependent implementations or systems -->

## Overview

[Brief description of the implementation, focusing on:

- What will we implement
- Why do we need to implement it
- Key objectives and success metrics
- Expected outcomes]

## Technical design

[C4 model diagram(s) with proposed change explicitly highlighted. Go from high level to low level, starting with the first relevant level of abstraction up to the component level.]

### Architecture changes

[Describe architectural changes, including:

- Systems, containers, and components affected
- New systems, containers, and components added
- Modified interfaces and data models
- System and container interactions]

### Interface definitions

[Document interface changes:

```smithy
namespace example

service ExampleService {
    version: "1.0.0",
    operations: [NewOperation]
}

operation NewOperation {
    input: NewOperationInput,
    output: NewOperationOutput
}

structure NewOperationInput {
    param: String
}

structure NewOperationOutput {
    returnType: String
}
```

]

### Data model changes

[Detail data model modifications:

- Schema changes
- New models
- Modified models
- Migration requirements

Use mermaid js uml diagram(s) to illustrate the data model changes.]

### Security considerations

[Document security aspects:

- Authentication changes
- Authorization requirements
- Data protection needs
- Security risks and mitigations

Use mermaid js diagram(s) (sequence or other as is most appropriate) to model authentication and data protection flows.]

### Performance implications

[Analyze performance impact:

- Expected load changes
- Resource requirements
- Scalability considerations
- Performance targets
- Monitoring and observability plans
- Remember that observability tools installed on a user machine are to be opt-in only.
