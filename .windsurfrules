# Project-specific rules

## Information verification

- Never make assumptions or speculate without clear evidence.
- If less than 90% confident in understanding a request, ask for clarification.

## Code change management

- Make changes file by file to allow for proper review.
- Combine all edits into a single chunk per file instead of separate steps.
- Only suggest updates to files that need modifications.

## File handling

- Always give links to real files (no placeholder x.md references)
- Never reference or consider earlier file versions from memory
- Do not show or discuss current implementations unless specifically requested
- Check provided file contents for current implementations

## Communication style

- Do not use apologies
- Avoid giving feedback about understanding (e.g., "Understood", "Got it")
- Never invent or suggest changes beyond what the user explicitly requested
