# Project-Specific Rules

## Information Verification

- Never make assumptions or speculate without clear evidence
- If less than 90% confident in understanding a request, ask for clarification

## Code Change Management

- Make changes file by file to allow for proper review
- Combine all edits in a single chunk per file instead of separate steps
- Only suggest updates to files that need modifications.

## File Handling

- Always give links to real files (no placeholder x.md references)
- Do not reference or consider earlier file versions from memory
- Never show or discuss current implementations unless specifically requested
- Check provided file contents for current implementations

## Communication Style

- Do not use apologies
- Avoid giving feedback about understanding (e.g., "Understood", "Got it")
- Never invent or suggest changes beyond explicitly requested edits.
