# 0002 Technical implementation plan template requirements

| **Status:** Accepted | **Driver:** @pfouilloux | **Date:** 28-12-2024 |

## Executive summary

In the context of technical project documentation,
facing the need for consistent and comprehensive implementation planning,
we decided for a structured technical implementation plan template
and against ad hoc implementation documentation.
This will achieve consistent, reviewable, and trackable technical implementations,
accepting additional upfront planning time and complexity.

## Context and problem statement

Technical implementations often vary in documentation quality and completeness, leading to:

- Inconsistent implementation approaches
- Missing critical considerations
- Difficult-to-review proposals
- Poor traceability of technical decisions
- Challenges in estimating and tracking progress

We need a template that ensures:

- Comprehensive technical planning
- Clear implementation steps
- Consistent documentation structure
- Traceable technical decisions
- Reviewable proposals

## Decision drivers

- Need for consistent implementation documentation
- Requirement for comprehensive technical planning
- Review efficiency requirements
- Implementation traceability needs
- Risk management requirements

## Considered options

- Option 1: Minimal implementation notes template
- Option 2: Comprehensive technical implementation plan template
- Option 3: Project-specific templates
- Option 4: No standardized template

## Decision outcome

Chosen option: "Comprehensive technical implementation plan template"

Rationale:

- Ensures consistent documentation across projects
- Provides clear structure for implementation planning
- Supports efficient review processes
- Enables better risk management
- Facilitates implementation tracking

### Essential template sections

1. Overview:
   - Implementation title and ID
   - Status tracking
   - Implementation owner
   - Target completion date
   - Dependencies

2. Technical Design:
   - Architecture changes
   - Interface definitions
   - Data model changes
   - Security considerations
   - Performance implications

3. Implementation Plan:
   - Phase breakdown
   - Task dependencies
   - Resource requirements
   - Timeline estimates
   - Testing approach

4. Risk Assessment:
   - Technical risks
   - Security implications
   - Performance impacts
   - Migration considerations
   - Mitigation strategies

5. Validation Criteria:
   - Acceptance criteria
   - Test requirements
   - Performance metrics
   - Security requirements
   - Documentation needs

### Explicitly excluded

1. Project Management Details:
   - Detailed schedules
   - Resource allocation
   - Budget information
   - Team assignments

2. Non-Technical Content:
   - Business justification
   - Market analysis
   - User documentation
   - Training materials

### Positive consequences

- Consistent implementation documentation
- Comprehensive technical planning
- Efficient review process
- Better risk management
- Clear implementation tracking

### Negative consequences

- Additional planning time and complexity
- Potential over-documentation for small changes
- Initial learning curve
- Could slow initial implementation start

## Benefits and drawbacks of options

### Option 1: Minimal implementation notes template

- Good, because reduces documentation complexity
- Good, because faster to complete
- Bad, because might miss critical considerations
- Bad, because more difficult to review consistently

### Option 2: Comprehensive technical implementation plan template

- Good, because ensures thorough planning
- Good, because supports consistent review
- Good, because enables better risk management
- Bad, because requires more upfront effort
- Bad, because could be excessive for small changes

### Option 3: Project-specific templates

- Good, because tailored to project needs
- Good, because optimized for project context
- Bad, because inconsistent across projects
- Bad, because requires template maintenance
- Bad, because complicates cross-project work

### Option 4: No standardized template

- Good, because maximum flexibility
- Good, because no template maintenance
- Bad, because inconsistent documentation
- Bad, because more difficult to review
- Bad, because risk of missing critical aspects
